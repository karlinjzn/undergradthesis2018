annote = {The reason why the cost side error, w is orthogonal with Z is in BLP was that in the cost equation the error is conditional on own model characteristics. ($\backslash$gamma W)

But in this paper, the supply side errors have the price elasticity of competitor and also market share in it. And the supply side error is not conditioned with competitor characteristics. Then how can the error not correlated to competitor characteristics?},

annote = {So basically this paper estimated the demand with BLP and Hausman type instruments, and then assuming different competition structure, estimated PCM (Price-Cost margin). 

Then compared the estimated PCM to the (crude) marginal cost information that he has gotten from somewhere else.

This paper is somewhat similar to what I was thinking about, but it is also different. For the merger analysis, the important thing is the estimate for cost.

One thing is that is it okay to assume that the retail margin as an additional cost to producers.},
